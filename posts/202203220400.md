This site is where I document my playthroughs in the Sims 3. I have several game files active with different families and one Legacy challenge file. I have installed three custom worlds: Legacy Island III by Rflong7; Alpine County by Western077; and Sunset Valley 2020 (Chocolate 2.0) by MrsFlynn & JagaTelesin. I'm using several Nraas mods for stability: ErrorTrap, GoHere, Saver, Register, Traffic, Overwatch, Tempest, Story Progression, Traveler, and MasterController. I've also altered the default settings recommended for playing the game in Steam on a modern computer. My version of the Sims 3 is the Steam version, with all of the available EP installed (except for Katy Perry content). I am not using any Store content.
