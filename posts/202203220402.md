The family name for my Legacy game is Stewart, and the patriarch of this first generation is Scotty Stewart, an adventurous bookworm who is also a neat genius and a virtuoso. His lifetime wish is to become a Tinkerer. Scotty Likes Songwriter music, PB&J, and the color Spiceberry. He is an Aries. 

Currently, he is following the Sports career and has developed his handiness and athletic skills so much that he received a 1000 simoleon scholarship to study Physical Education for 2 terms. On campus, Scotty has earned money gathering herbs for the science professors, being a test subject and donating plasma. The job opportunities on the university campus pay fairly well, and have helped to buy lunch at the diner on several occasions. Scotty also could afford to take a class to learn to play bass, his preferred instrument.
